## **Purpose** 
A surf shop franchise requested weather data analysis to determine where to open up a new shop in Hawaii. After initial findings were discussed, the statical summary for the following months was requested by the executive team:
- **June** *2010-2017, temperature data*
- **December** *2010-2017, temperature data*

## Resources
- hawaii.sqlite
- Software: Python 3.7.7

## Analytics Summary

#
![December Temperature Statistics](https://github.com/zborglin/surfs_up/blob/main/resources/dec_temp.png)

## Results
Analyzing the June and December temperature data gives a strong perspective of yearly temperature in Hawaii given the months fall in the middle of summer and winter respectively. A few observations can be made from the data:
1. There is only a 5deg F average temperature difference between June and December, enabling surfing all year long.
2. The lowest temperature recorded in June is in the 60's while in December it fell within the 50's. A day in the 50's will negatively impact the surfing business.
3. Temperature is hihgly consistent for both months given the low standard deviation of 3.4-3.7 degrees. 

## Strategic Recommendations
In order to improve the analysis, it is recommended that the executive board fund the following analysis:
1. **Number of days with Precipitation**: Presence of rain is another indicator of surf popularity that will provide valuable details along with temperature data.
2. **Proximity of proposed surf shop locations to weather stations**: The presented weather data comes from a variety of weather stations. In order to reduce risk of mis-judging weather data for the proposed surf shop sites, it will be important to understand if the site will be nearby one of the more active weather stations. If a location is close to an active weather station, then the results presented will be more representative.
